An aws key is needed to pull data from 990 forms, from this most of the data can be requested. Any charity with a website can be scraped further.

Python scripts in here were working with data which was manually downloaded, https://github.com/Cosmic-Onion/990-xml-reader allows us to request this data without downloading huge XML files.
